# Mission-To-Mars


The purpose of this repo is to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about Mars, store it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. I then altered this app to to create a web app that includes all four of the Mars hemisphere images. To do this, I used use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database.
